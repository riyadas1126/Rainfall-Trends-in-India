**Rainfall Analysis in India (1901–2015)**
**Project Overview**
This project analyzes rainfall trends in India from 1901 to 2015, focusing on patterns, anomalies, and seasonal variations. It uses statistical techniques, machine learning, and forecasting models to study rainfall variability and predict future trends (2016–2035).

**Key Features**
Trend Analysis: Evaluates annual and seasonal rainfall patterns.
Anomaly Detection: Identifies extreme rainfall years using Isolation Forest.
Clustering: Groups rainfall patterns into 'Dry,' 'Normal,' and 'Wet' categories with K-Means clustering.
Forecasting: Predicts future rainfall trends using Linear Regression.
Visualization: Generates charts for insights into rainfall behavior.

**Technologies Used**
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)
Data Visualization

**Results**
Strong dependence on monsoon (June–September) for annual rainfall.
Identified extreme years with droughts and floods.
Predicted a slight decline in rainfall over the next 20 years.

**Recommendations**
Water Resource Management: Improve irrigation and groundwater systems.
Disaster Preparedness: Implement flood and drought early-warning systems.
Climate Adaptation: Develop resilient agricultural practices and policies.

**Conclusion**
The project highlights rainfall variability and its implications for climate resilience. It emphasizes the need for sustainable water management and disaster mitigation strategies to address future challenges.
